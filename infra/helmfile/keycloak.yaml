## NOTES
# Keycloak operator generates an admin password for you (no option to override) and it seems to be base64 encoded twice (?)
#  What's generated appears to be junk
# I've manually updated the secret it creates with a new password, and restarted the pod
# This doesn't seem to really work. So I had to drop the database and then restart again to get the right username/password in
